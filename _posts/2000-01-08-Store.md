## Balloon Dog Gear

### The Balloon Dog is the unoffical mascot of the Greeley Blended Learning Team, but that doesn't mean you can't sport the same gear we do! Use the order form below to order your very own Balloon Dog t-shirt or hoodie!

Orders are for local pickup, however, if you aren't local to Greeley, then you can arrange shipping at an additional cost with [Ryan Fitzpatrick](mailto:rfitzpatrick@greeleyschools.org)
