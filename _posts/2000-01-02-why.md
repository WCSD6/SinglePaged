Greeley-Evans School District 6 has implemented blended learning in 10 of our elementary, K-8 and middle schools, focusing on Targeted Instruction, Tight Feedback Loops, Student Ownership, and Quality Student-to-Student Interactions. Additionally, over the course of the 2015-16 school year, we saw impressive gains among blended students as measured by the district's common assessments -- students in grades 2-5 in blended classrooms outperformed the district average on every Math and ELA common assessment.
