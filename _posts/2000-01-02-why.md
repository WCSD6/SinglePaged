Greeley-Evans School District 6 has implemented blended learning in 10 of our elementary, K-8 and middle schools, focusing on **targeted instruction, tight feedback loops, student ownership,** and **quality student-to-student interactions.** Additionally, over the course of the 2015-16 school year, we saw impressive gains among blended students as measured by the district's common assessments.

Visitors from districts and other educational organizations are invited to join us to see teachers in action! We have received  national recognition for  our  implementation and strong results led us to design our first blended learning summit for October 13, 2016, which will feature school tours and workshops centered on our design process.
