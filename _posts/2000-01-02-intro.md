### Julia Freeland Fisher

#### Director of Research at the Clayton Christensen Institute

Who you know matters, especially in education. Julia Freeland Fisher believes expanding students’ networks – their stock of “social capital” – will be a game changer for the future of education.

A highly regarded expert in the fields of blended and competency-based learning, Fisher aims to expand who students know by enhancing their access and ability to navigate new peer, mentor and professional networks. Her current research focuses on the emerging tools and practices that can accomplish this. The director of research at the Clayton Christensen Institute (Institute), she and her team are working to educate policymakers and community leaders on the power of disruptive innovation in the K-12 and higher education spheres. Fisher is dedicated to transforming monolithic, factory-model education systems into student-centered designs that educate every student successfully and enable each to realize his or her fullest potential.

Fisher has published and spoken extensively on trends in the EdTech market, blended learning, competency-based education and the future of schools. Her writing has appeared in outlets including EducationNext, Forbes, Entrepreneur.com, Chicago Sun-Times and the New Hampshire Union Leader. Her recent white papers – including “The educator’s dilemma: When and how schools should embrace poverty relief” with Michael B. Horn, “Schools and software: What’s now and what’s next” with Alex Hernandez, and “Blending toward competency: Early patterns of blended learning and competency-based education in New Hampshire” – zero in on how disruptive innovations are changing the education landscape.

Prior to joining the Institute, Fisher worked at NewSchools Venture Fund, a venture philanthropy organization that supports education entrepreneurs who are transforming public education. She also served as an instructor in the Yale College Seminar Program. Fisher holds a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University and a JD from Yale Law School.
